# Alarm-Clock

Welcome to my project repository! This project showcases the various programming concepts and techniques I have learned. The primary focus is on understanding and implementing these concepts rather than perfecting the design or creating production-ready solutions.

This repository contains an Alarm Clock application that allows users to set alarms and activate a snooze feature based on the specified time.

## What I had learnt

- API
- Audio fetch method
- shortcut key handeling

## Acknowledgements
